    Abstractâ€”Smart contracts are programs running on a blockchain. They are immutable to change, and hence can not be patched for
bugs once deployed. Thus it is critical to ensure they are bug-free and well-designed before deployment. A Contract defect is an error,
flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The
detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain
numerous distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to find smart contract specified defects. To fill this
gap, we collected smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world smart contracts. We manually
analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential
security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as
harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. Feedback showed these contract defects
are harmful and removing them would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually identified our defined
contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and publicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by
contract defects. These help developers better understand the symptoms of the defects and removal priority.
